the source code that is the high level languge which the programmer writes  which is converted to the object code which is nothing but 
the output of the program in the machine language i.e. the understandable. one 
then this is stored in the disk. the linker links it with the standard libraries and creat it in the form of executable file 
 this is stored it in the memory of the cpu then cpu takes the instruction and then checks it out with the memory then
