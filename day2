programmer creats the program edits it and then stores in the disk the processor processes the code this is sent to compiler where
the source code that is the high level languge which the programmer writes  which is converted to the object code which is nothing but 
the output of the program in the machine language i.e. the understandable. one 
then this is stored in the disk. the linker links it with the standard libraries and creat it in the form of executable file 
 this is stored it in the memory of the cpu then cpu takes the instruction and then checks it out with the memory then 
it finally executes the file

what is program?
In computing, a program is a specific set of the ordered functions to perform by the computer

  what is function
  the named section of programs that perform specific task
  
 what is preprocessor
 Before a C program is compiled in a compiler, source code is processed by a program called preprocessor. commands 
 used in the preprocessor r preprocessor directive which begin with the the # include
 
 what is the work of compiler
 compiler read the source code n then convert the source code into the binary form which is also called the machine code or the object code
 which is understandable language to the code this  is called the compilation process.
 
what are the high level language 
 the language which has a lot of abstraction in it 
 
 what are the low level language 
 this are the language which is having less abstraction or no abstraction.
 
 what are linker
  the linker combines many files into a unified executable program, resolving the symbols as it goes along.
  
  what are standard library
  A standard library in computer programming is the library made available after  implementing a lot of a programming language
