#include asks to include whatever is given
execution of the program begins from the main
int  takes the integer values ony
printf prints the given 
scanf takes the input values   from the user
sum=integer1+integer2 assigns the operation to the program

what does return 0 mean 
what is the meaning of %d and \n
\n means it tell the compiler to take the inputalue after a line
f we donot write this then to our program will run but her it takes the value given by the user in the same line of the printed line


 #include<stdio.h>
  int main() 
  { 
  int integer1;
  int integer2;
  int sum;
   
   printf("enter first integer\n");
   scanf("%d",&integer1);
   
   printf("enter second integer\n");
   scanf("%d",&integer2);
   
   sum=integer1+integer2;
    
    printf("sum is %d\n",sum); 
    
    return 0;
    }
