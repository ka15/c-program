i had not mentioned int nefore writing the integer n then it was showing integer not defined so the i looked on to the original copy ,corrrected my mistake
i had not mentioned the " before n after the () of printf  
i had not written  return 0 at the last
 

questions 
why we need to mention int before integer 
 
 why we have to put the "" before n after the ()of print f
 
 can't we write both the integer in one print f and declare
 
 is return 0 must to write when we use int maina()
